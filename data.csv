The case in which the 37-year-old faces a jail for a year will be heard on May 1.Mr Gambhir who had not responded to the matter so far took a swipe at AAP today calling it "negative politics"."When you don't have a vision and have done nothing in the last 4.5 years you make such allegations. The Election Commission will decide this. When you have a vision you don't do such negative politics" Gautam Gambhir said.,
